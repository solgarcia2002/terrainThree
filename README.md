Terrain Navigation:

Based on threeJS it was implemented a PlaneBufferGeometry and applied to it Perlin noise in order to create the soil ups and downs.
Also it was added First Person navigation controls, modified in order to give the user the ability to go forward 5 times and triggering a messege after the 5th click or tap in touch devices.
